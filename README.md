# UCB-refactorWebsite-HW
to begin this project I created a repository on my Github linked to my local machine. From there I was able to create an Index.html file with copied code in order to avoid altering original source.

I refactored this code within Visual studio Code. Listed below is a list of all the changes done to this page, starting from the top of the webpage to the bottom:

<html> 
1.Spaced all content between the <html> tags to format under the parent to add better legibility.
2. The whole page needed to be properly indented with their relative position within the page. 

<head>
1. in <head> I added a website title of "Horiseon" in the <title> tags.
2. Spaced a line between the <head>  and <body>  tags to seperate sections.

<body>
1. in class <header> I changed the <div> tag to a <header> tag in order to seperate the information in the layout, creating the top of the body.
2. In <header> added <nav> tags for the link navigation list items. Also changed the CSS rule in order to select <nav> tags with the list items
3. commented out each section to make legible labels for each part of content
4. Added alt="" attributes to each image as well as descriptions for images
5.reorganized the <h> tags to be in order for page to evenly flow the size of headings throughout the page.
6. Changed all <div> tags to coincide with more appropriate labels of division for the content.
7. the content section changed from <div> tags to <article> as these sections are main content. 
8. Benefits section changed <div> tags to <aside> tags to coincide with their sidebar information.
