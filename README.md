# UCB-refactorWebsite-HW
to begin this project I created a repository on my Github linked to my local machine. From there I was able to create an Index.html file with copied code in order to avoid altering original source.

I refactored this code within Visual studio Code. Listed below is a list of all the changes done to this page, starting from the top of the webpage to the bottom:

## Horiseon Solutions - Refactoring original source code
This Project is a refactoring of the Source code Provided by Horiseon Solutions. For this Project, I refactored the source code of the website in order to follow semantic HTML conventions to better optimize search engine results and accessibility. Included within this README.md file is a list of all the changes to the source code made. This project did not change any of the content or styling of the webpage, just the structuring and labeling of the html and corresponding elements. All functionality with the original structure is still in place, index.html is now more precise and organized with original content.  

## Refactoring 
### <html> 
1.Spaced all content between the <html> tags to format under the parent to add better legibility.
2. The whole page needed to be properly indented with their relative position within the page. 

### <head>
1. in <head> I added a website title of "Horiseon" in the <title> tags.
2. Spaced a line between the <head>  and <body>  tags to seperate sections.

### <body>
1. in class <header> I changed the <div> tag to a <header> tag in order to seperate the information in the layout, creating the top of the body.
2. In <header> added <nav> tags for the link navigation list items. Also changed the CSS rule in order to select <nav> tags with the list items
3. commented out each section to make legible labels for each part of content
4. Added alt="" attributes to each image as well as descriptions for images
5.reorganized the <h> tags to be in order for page to evenly flow the size of headings throughout the page.
6. Changed all <div> tags to coincide with more appropriate labels of division for the content.
7. the content section changed from <div> tags to <article> as these sections are main content. 
8. Benefits section changed <div> tags to <aside> tags to coincide with their sidebar information.
